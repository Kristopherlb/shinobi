# Auto Scaling Group Observability Assets

This directory captures observability collateral for the Auto Scaling Group component. The CloudWatch alarms synthesised by the component are described in the audit deliverable (`audit/auto-scaling-group.audit.md`). Future work should add reusable dashboards and OTEL collector templates as called out in the platform observability standard.
