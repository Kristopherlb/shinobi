# DynamoDB Table Component Audit Assets

This directory hosts compliance artifacts consumed by the Shinobi MCP server. The initial scaffold contains:

- `component.plan.json` – placeholder plan referencing the component type.
- `rego/` – reserved for OPA policies that enforce component guardrails.

Additional audit rules and supporting materials should be added as part of future compliance enhancements.
