### ✅ Binder Matrix Completeness

**Supported Bindings:** ✅ COMPLIANT
- Lambda → Certificate (read, use, write)
- API Gateway → Certificate (use)
- CloudFront → Certificate (use)
- Load Balancer → Certificate (use)
- Any component → Certificate (monitor)

**Binding Examples:**
```typescript
// Lambda binding to certificate
{
  source: 'lambda-api',
  target: 'certificate:acm',
  access: ['read', 'use']
}

// API Gateway binding to certificate
{
  source: 'api-gateway-rest',
  target: 'certificate:acm',
  access: ['use']
}
```

**No Missing Bindings:** ✅ COMPLIANT
- All logical bindings are supported
- No obvious binding gaps identified
- Comprehensive coverage for certificate usage
- Platform supports all common scenarios

### ✅ Data Contract Consistency

**Capability Data Contract:** ✅ COMPLIANT
- Component provides: `certificateArn`, `domainName`, `validationMethod`, `keyAlgorithm`
- Binder expects: `certificateArn`, `domainName`, `validationMethod`, `keyAlgorithm`
- Perfect alignment between provider and consumer
- No missing or mismatched fields

**Data Contract Validation:**
```typescript
// Component provides
return {
  certificateArn: this.certificate!.certificateArn,
  domainName: this.config.domainName,
  validationMethod: this.config.validation.method,
  keyAlgorithm: this.config.keyAlgorithm
};

// Binder expects
const certificateArn = targetComponent.certificateArn;
const domainName = targetComponent.domainName;
const validationMethod = targetComponent.validationMethod;
const keyAlgorithm = targetComponent.keyAlgorithm;
```

## Binder Strategy Implementation Analysis

### ✅ Certificate Binder Strategy Quality

**Comprehensive Support:** ✅ COMPLIANT
- Supports multiple access patterns: read, write, validate, monitor, use
- Handles different capability types: acm, validation, monitoring
- Proper error handling and validation
- Clear separation of concerns

**Access Pattern Support:**
```typescript
const validAccessTypes = ['read', 'write', 'validate', 'monitor', 'use'];
```

**Capability Handling:**
```typescript
switch (capability) {
  case 'certificate:acm':
    await this.bindToCertificate(sourceComponent, targetComponent, binding, context);
    break;
  case 'certificate:validation':
    await this.bindToValidation(sourceComponent, targetComponent, binding, context);
    break;
  case 'certificate:monitoring':
    await this.bindToMonitoring(sourceComponent, targetComponent, binding, context);
    break;
}
```

### ✅ Security and Compliance

**Least Privilege:** ✅ COMPLIANT
