  alarmDescription: 'Certificate approaching expiration',
  metric: new cloudwatch.Metric({
    namespace: 'AWS/CertificateManager',
    metricName: 'DaysToExpiry',
    dimensionsMap: { CertificateArn: this.certificate!.certificateArn },
    statistic: 'Minimum',
    period: cdk.Duration.hours(expiration.periodHours)
  }),
  threshold: expiration.threshold ?? expiration.thresholdDays,
  evaluationPeriods: expiration.evaluationPeriods ?? 1,
