## 🔒 Security & Identity

*Note: Security services are typically managed through IAM policies and don't require specific binder strategies, but they can be integrated with other services.*

## 💾 Storage Services

*Note: S3 binder strategy is already implemented in the existing platform.*

## 🔄 Integration & Messaging

*Note: SQS and SNS binder strategies are already implemented in the existing platform.*

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### ECS Fargate Service Binding
```yaml
binds:
  - from: api-service
    to: ecs-cluster
    capability: ecs:cluster
    access: [read, write]
  - from: api-service
    to: database-service
    capability: ecs:service
    access: [read]
```

### DynamoDB Table Binding
```yaml
binds:
  - from: api-service
    to: user-table
    capability: dynamodb:table
    access: [read, write]
  - from: analytics-service
    to: user-table
    capability: dynamodb:stream
    access: [process]
```

### VPC Network Binding
```yaml
binds:
  - from: api-service
    to: private-subnet
    capability: vpc:subnet
    access: [read]
  - from: api-service
    to: security-group
    capability: vpc:security-group
    access: [write]
```

## 🛡️ Compliance Features

### FedRAMP Moderate
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- VPC endpoint configuration
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Backup retention policies

### FedRAMP High
- FIPS-140-2 compliant encryption
- STIG-hardened configurations
- Extended backup retention (30 days)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- VPC Flow Logs enabled

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Least Privilege Access**: All binder strategies implement least privilege IAM policies
- **Resource Optimization**: Strategies configure appropriate resource limits
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration for all services
- **Caching**: Strategies support caching where applicable
- **Auto-scaling**: Integration with auto-scaling services

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

1. **Plugin Architecture**: Support for third-party binder strategies
2. **Service Mesh Integration**: Enhanced service-to-service communication
3. **Multi-Region Support**: Cross-region binding capabilities
4. **Cost Optimization**: Automatic resource optimization based on usage patterns
5. **Advanced Monitoring**: Custom dashboards and alerting
