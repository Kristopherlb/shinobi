# Testing & Quality Assurance

## Test Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: Component logic, business rules, utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions, database operations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full user workflows, API contracts
- **Compliance Tests**: Policy validation, security controls

## Test Execution
- **Local Development**: `pnpm test` for unit and integration tests
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Full test suite with coverage reporting
- **Pre-deployment**: `svc validate` for manifest and policy validation
- **Post-deployment**: `svc local up` for smoke testing

## Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 90% code coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: All critical paths covered
- **API Tests**: All endpoints with success and error scenarios
- **Security Tests**: All security controls validated

## Quality Gates
- **Build**: TypeScript compilation, linting, formatting
- **Test**: Unit tests, integration tests, coverage thresholds
- **Security**: SAST, dependency scanning, policy validation
- **Performance**: Load testing, latency benchmarks

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Component business logic
