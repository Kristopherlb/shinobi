# Component Versioning & Metadata Audit â€“ dynamodb-table

## Observations
- `package.json` and the embedded `component` metadata both advertise version `1.0.0`, keeping registry identifiers consistent.[^ver-package]
- The changelog documents the initial 1.0.0 release with feature, security, and documentation highlights, aligning with Keep a Changelog expectations.[^ver-changelog]
- `catalog-info.yaml` publishes the same component type and describes provided capabilities (`db:dynamodb`), ensuring the Backstage catalog stays in sync with package metadata.[^ver-catalog]

## Findings
- No discrepancies between package version, component metadata, and documented release notes were detected. Versioning appears to follow semantic conventions.

## Recommendations
- Continue to increment semantic versions alongside changelog updates whenever the component changes to preserve MCP catalog accuracy.
