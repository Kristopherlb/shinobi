# Logging Standard Audit – dynamodb-table

## Observations
- The component acquires a platform logger via `getLogger()` and emits structured lifecycle events (start, config resolved, synthesis complete) with contextual metadata, aligning with the structured logging mandate.[^log-usage]
- Failures route through `logger.error` with the thrown `Error` instance and structured context, enabling correlation with compliance-driven log schemas.[^log-error]
- No `console.log` or other unstructured logging calls were found in the package.[^log-search]

## Findings
- No deviations from the Platform Structured Logging Standard were detected for this component. The logger integration satisfies the requirements for structured, contextual logging.[^log-standard]

## Recommendations
- None – maintain the current pattern and extend structured logging to any new operational branches that get introduced.
